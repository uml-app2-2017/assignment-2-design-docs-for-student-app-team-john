# Problem Statement

Students as well as ever day people struggle to keep a well-rounded schedule in
their daily lives. Most people focus only on things they want to do and tend to
spend time on strong areas in life and don’t work on their weak points in life.
The *Smart Schedule* is an app that will work with people’s needs and see what
there strengths and weakness are and help them form a more rounded schedule to
make them a more rounded person in their life.
