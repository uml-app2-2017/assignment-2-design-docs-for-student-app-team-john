## Student developers

**Student Developers** need **testers** for an android application that they are
creating. They **post fliers** on bulletin boards and on an online bulletin
board asking **students** that want to **change** their lifeâ€™s and become more
**well rounded** people to test their application. The first week they receive
10 students requesting to test their application. They meet with the students
to watch over how they set up of the scheduling going taking into account any
**questions and concerns** that they users may have. After they have picked a
schedules student that **best suits** them they set up a meeting in a month to
see how the students do with their new schedules and if they are keeping up
with them. They also ask the testers to give them feedback on how the schedule
has changed their daily life. The testers are **rewarded** with a $25 gift
card for fully testing the application.
